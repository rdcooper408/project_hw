Pseudo Code:
 # Download Axolotl transcripts and store in large file
 # make that file a searchable database
 # clean up the database
 
 # Put file into the cluster analysis software
 # "purify" the transcripts so that i get them down to gene families
 # Blast sequences against Xenopus genome
 # save list of proteins to a text file
 
 # run the list of proteins through BLAST-II-GO
 # Pull out the genes that are associated with metamorphosis
 
 # design capture array to target these specific genes
 # write code to write a report for me... im thinking DeepDive????
